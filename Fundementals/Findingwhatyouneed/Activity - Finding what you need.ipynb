    "## Scenario: Taming the Book Stacks: Sorting and Searching in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're looking for a specific book in a large library.  The endless rows of shelves can be overwhelming, and finding that one title can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, you'll learn how to use Python to make searching a digital library much easier and more efficient. You'll explore sorting algorithms, which organize book data in a logical way, just like arranging books on a shelf. Then, you'll dive into search algorithms - these are like having your own digital librarian to help you quickly find the exact book you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Sorting and Searching Algorithms Matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient Navigation:** Sorting algorithms arrange book data in a logical order, making it easier for users (or librarians!) to browse and find what they need. Think of it like arranging books alphabetically on a shelf – it saves everyone time and frustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rapid Retrieval :** Search algorithms enable quick and precise book lookup. Whether you're searching by title, author, or other criteria, these algorithms act like a librarian's expert knowledge, pinpointing the desired book efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalability :** As libraries grow (and digital collections can grow very large), sorting and searching algorithms become even more crucial. They ensure that the library system remains responsive and user-friendly, even with thousands or millions of books.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexibility :** These algorithms aren't just for libraries. They are fundamental tools for organizing and accessing data in countless applications, from online stores to search engines. Understanding them equips you with valuable skills for working with data in any field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activity Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sort Book Data:** Learn how to sort a list of book dictionaries, creating a well-organized digital catalog.\n",
    "* **Implement Linear Search:** Discover how to systematically search through your book collection, examining each item one by one.\n",
    "* **Implement Binary Search:** Explore a more efficient search method that leverages sorted data to quickly find specific books.\n",
    "* **Compare and Contrast:** Understand the tradeoffs between different search algorithms, empowering you to choose the best approach for various scenarios.\n"

    "1. **Run the Following Two Cells:** The cells below each already have the query set to `\"The Great Gatsby\"`. Each cell also has uses the `time` module to measure the execution time of the `search_books` and `binary_search_books` functions by recording timestamps before and after the search and then calculating the difference. Note that the exact times will vary based on your system's power, but expect an extremely quick search in the binary search compared to the binary. Also note, Jupyter Notebooks may \"cache\" search results, so running the same query twice may end up with times that appear to be zero. You can have Jupyter \"Restart the kernel\" to get fresh results.\n",
