    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing your first task as a data analyst at the insect collection company! You've successfully applied your Python debugging skills to identify and resolve various errors, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the insect collection database. Let's recap what you've learned:\n",

    "* FileNotFoundError: You've learned how to troubleshoot issues related to missing or inaccessible data files, ensuring your scripts can locate and read the crucial insect collection records.\n",
    "\n",
    "* TypeError: You've navigated through type-related errors, ensuring that you're performing operations on compatible data types (like numerical measurements and species names) and converting them when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* IndexError: You've mastered list indexing and learned how to avoid accessing insect records beyond their valid range, preventing unexpected crashes in your data cleaning scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* KeyError: You've gained confidence in working with insect data dictionaries, ensuring that you're accessing existing keys (like 'species' or 'leg count') and handling missing keys gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AttributeError: You now understand the distinction between different data types and their available methods, avoiding attempts to use incompatible operations on insect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ZeroDivisionError: You've learned how to prevent division by zero errors by implementing checks and providing alternative solutions when encountering such scenarios, especially when calculating ratios or proportions based on insect attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging is an essential part of programming. It's about systematically identifying and fixing errors in your code. Don't get discouraged if you encounter errors; it's a natural part of the learning process!"
