    "* **Lists - Inventory Management:** Efficiently manage and update our inventory list using Python lists. We'll practice adding new items, removing out-of-stock products, and ensuring our inventory is always up-to-date.\n",

    "* **Tuples - Immutable Data:** Explore the concept of immutability with tuples and understand their suitability for storing fixed data, such as product IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dictionaries - Inventory Lookup:** Utilize dictionaries to create a dynamic inventory database. We'll learn how to load inventory data from a CSV file, access and update stock levels, and handle item additions and removals.\n",

    "## Project Recap: Managing Inventory at The Furry Foodie with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the Furry Foodie inventory management project! You've successfully applied your Python skills to keep our shelves stocked and our furry customers happy. Let's recap what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lists:** You've mastered how to use lists to represent and manage inventory. You've added new items, removed out-of-stock products, and kept everything organized, ensuring we never run out of the treats our pets love.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tuples:** You've learned how to leverage the immutability of tuples to store crucial product identifiers, guaranteeing data integrity and preventing accidental modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dictionaries:** You've harnessed the power of dictionaries to create a flexible and efficient inventory database. You've added new products, updated stock levels, checked for item availability, and even removed discontinued items from the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterating over Dictionaries:** You've used loops to traverse dictionaries, extracting key-value pairs to generate clear and informative inventory reports, keeping both management and customers well-informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Working with External Data:** You've learned how to load and process data from a CSV file using the pandas library, enabling you to interact with real-world datasets.\n"
